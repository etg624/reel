# Evan Guirino Reel Assessment

## Thank you again for this opportunity to apply to reel.

This little app is built in react and uses redux for state management.

- To get up and running run clone this repo and cd into the project directory. When in the directory run `npm install` in your terminal and `npm start` to run the app in localhost.

I started building this app by planning out my component structure. My main concern with the component structure was to keep things modularized and separate concerns for future testing and reusability. I made a point to include redux for every state change.

As far as design I went for a more elegant look. Something simple but, pleasing to the eye. If I had some more assets to work with I could add a header and footer to make the app look more complete.

Thank you again for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing your feedback!
