# Evan Guirino Reel Assessment

## Thank you again for this opportunity to apply to reel.

This little app is built in react and uses redux for state management.

- To get up and running run `npm install` in your terminal and `npm start` to run the app in localhost.

It has multiple components to try to keep things modularized and separate concerns.

As far as design I went for a more elegant look. Something simple but, is pleasing to the eye. If I had some more assets to work with I could add a header and footer to make the app look more complete.
